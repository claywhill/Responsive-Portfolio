            As an avid adventurer, I am drawn to beautiful, wild, desolate, and rugged places. They allure me with their untamable and mysterious grandeur. Of all these magnificent places, the Rocky Mountains are what I treasure most. The quote by John Muir, "The mountains are calling and I must go," was something I truly experienced. After living in Montana right after I graduated college, then shortly moving to Colorado, I fell in love with the mountains. After a few short years I moved back to my home state of Arkansas. While a beautiful state in its own right, it did not inspire me like the states out west. This is when I heard the mountains calling. So I went. I now call Colorado home.

            Living in Colorado allows me to spend most of my free time wandering through the mountains where I enjoy hiking, fishing, snowboarding, exploring, and occasionally snapping a few photos. Every trip to the mountains draws me in deeper, leaving me with a desire to experience more.

            Although I enjoy several activites, hiking is definitely the ultimate experience. It is the best way to see and explore the state. Legs can take you infinitely more places than a vehicle. I love the challenge of hiking the state's 14ers. My goal is to summit all 58 in the state. Hiking these giants gives me some of the best views. I can see for miles in every direction. Each new 14er gives me new, beautiful perspective of just how magnificent the Rocky Mountains truly are.
